In 2004, the Gallo family decided to try their take on the American cuisine and opened their first taproom off of Bethel Road. What started off as the neighborhood watering hole that valued fresh, local ingredients – and of course the Buckeyes, turned into one of the top premium sports venues in the city with the best selection of craft beer and a chef-driven menu. 12 years later, determined to bring those same core values to other Columbus neighborhoods – The Gallo’s Tap Room in Powell was established.
